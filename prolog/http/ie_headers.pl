% `X-Powered-By' specifies the technology (e.g. ASP.NET, PHP, JBoss) supporting
% the Web application (version details are often in `X-Runtime', `X-Version',
% or `X-AspNet-Version').
%
% # Examples
%

% X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
% X-Powered-By: PHP/5.4.0
% ```

%! 'x-xss-protection'(-Status:oneof([block,optin,optout]))// ,
% Internet Explorer 8 included a novel new feature to help prevent reflected
% cross-site scripting attacks, known as the XSS Filter.  This filter runs by
% default in the Internet, Trusted, and Restricted security zones.  Local
% Intranet zone pages may opt-in to the protection using the same header:
%
% ```http
% X-XSS-Protection: 1
% ```
%
% If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, Internet Explorer 8 and 9
% will attempt to make the smallest possible modification to the returned
% web page in order to block the attack.  In most cases, the modification is to
% change one or more characters in the returned page into the hash character
% (“#”) breaking any script that may have been reflected from the outbound HTTP
% request.
%
% Pages that have been secured against XSS via server-side logic may opt-out of
% this protection using a HTTP response header:
%
% ```http
% X-XSS-Protection: 0
% ```
%
% In March of 2010, we added to IE8 support for a new token in the
% X-XSS-Protection header, `mode=block'.
%
% ```http
% X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
% ```
%
% When this token is present, if a potential XSS Reflection attack is detected,
% Internet Explorer will prevent rendering of the page.  Instead of attempting
% to sanitize the page to surgically remove the XSS attack, IE will render only
% “#”.
