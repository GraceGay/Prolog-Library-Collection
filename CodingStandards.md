# Code Standards

In order to keep code short and interpretable I try to maintain
certain patterns / conventions thoughout the codebase.  I do not
believe that a computer program can be automatically formatted to look
a specific way.  In the end, the way in which the program is written
down into text is something that should optimize for a human reader
(including the author).  Therefore, the presentation of a program is
inherently something that cannot be automated.  However, it still
makes sense to come up with certain patters / conventions that are
often applicable.

## Indentation

2 spaces.  2, because 4 or 8 causes too much space to be wasted for no
aparent reason.  (I am not sure why I do not use 1 or 3 spaces.)
Spaces, because that makes it easier to anticipate how code looks in
different editors and configurations (where tabs will mess up
meaningful alignments and ASCII artistry).

## Newlines

The US-ASCII newline character (Unix convention).

Every text file should end with a newline character.  This means that
every line ends with the same character (uniformity).  It also means
that line counting can be unambiguously applied.  Another benefit is
that when a file is listed from the command line the prompt does not
het cought up in the middle of the last listed line (but appears in
the left hand side of the next line, where we expect it to be).

## Character margin

80, because this is the most common setting in other programs and it
allows 2 buffers to be displayed next to each other on most displays.

## Abbreviations

We use the following abbreviations for often occurring variable names:
